# Unit2.Froyo
Unit2.Froyo

A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee. When they view the browser console, they observe a table listing how many of each flavor they have ordered. In this case, they will be able to observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee, and one strawberry froyo.

There is no starter code for this workshop; the solutions to previous workshops will be great to review!

Create a new repository named Unit2.Froyo on GitHub and clone it down.
Open the project with VS Code and create an HTML file and a JavaScript file.
Figure out a plan for what code you'll need to write based on the user story. Use the rubric to guide you.

<!-- Can you live serve the HTML file?
Is the HTML file connected to the JS file?
Can you prompt the user for froyo flavors and store their result? -->

<!-- Can you parse the user input into an array of froyo flavors? -->

Can you build an object to track which flavors you have observed so far?

As you iterate through the array of flavors, when should that object be updated?

Is your logic organized into a function?
